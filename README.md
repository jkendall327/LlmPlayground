# LlmPlayground

Ever wondered what it would feel like if independent large language models carried a conversation while roleplaying their own characters? LlmPlayground explores that idea by orchestrating multiple LLMs—each with its own persona—instead of asking a single model to juggle every role.

Because every participant is powered by a distinct model instance, each character can maintain secret knowledge, hidden motivations, and unique goals without leaking them to the others. The result is a more convincing and immersive roleplaying experience, closer to how real people interact.
